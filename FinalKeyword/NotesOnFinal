-> final is a reserved keyword in Java
-> We can use final for 
 #Class
 # Variable
 # Method
 If we declare a class as a final then our class will become
 immutable
 
 Ex - String Class.
 
 For Final classes inheritance isn't possible
 final variable value cannot be modified as it is nothing
 but constant
 Final methods cannot be overridden
