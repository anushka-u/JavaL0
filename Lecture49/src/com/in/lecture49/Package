Packages
===============

Packages are used to group the classes and interfaces,exceptions and errors.
In java class package statement should be in first line.
In java language, so many classes & interfaces are already available
Ex: String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder, Arrays, BufferedReader, Scanner etc....

-> Some people divided predefined classes and interfaces into several packages
1> java.lang
2> java.io
3> java.util
4> java.sql

-> java.lang package is default package and it is available for all java classes by default
-> If we want to use any other class which is not part of java.lang then we will have to import that class.

==========================================
USER Defined Packages
============================================

-> In our project we will create our own packages to organise project related classes and interfaces.
-> to create a package we will use package keyword
  ex package com.tcs.aadhar;
  sample package name : companyname.projectNAme.moduleNAme
  
 
Note: In project we can create 2 classes with same name in 2 different packages.
