Blocks in Java
=================

Block means some part or some piece of information or some piece of code

There are two type of Blocks-
Instance Block
Static Block

==============|
Instance Block|
==============|

If you want to execute some piece of code when object is created then we will go
for instance block

{
	//stmts
}


Instance block does have high priority than constructor
===============|
Static Block   |
===============|

If we want to execute some piece of code when class is loaded then we can go with 
static block

syntax:
static{
 	//stmts
 	
 }
 
 Static block will dominate the main method, it will have high priority than main() method
 =======================================================================================
 
 Que: What is static control flow and what is instance control flow?
 
 Ans -> When we run java program JVM will check for below static member and will allocate memory for them
 a) static variables
 b) static methods
 c) static block
 
 -> Once memory allocation completed for static member then it will static execution in below order
 a) static block
 b) static method (if we call) (only main method will execute automatically)
 c) static variable
 
 If java program will run then static block will be executed before main method.
 upto java 1.6 Java Program was able to execute using static block but from java v1.7 they have 
 made main() mandatory to run java program.
 
 Instance variable cannot be written in static block directly, if  we want access for instance variable
 or instance method in static are then we should create object and using that object we can access , we cannot access directlt
 
 We can access static variable in static method directly.
 
 
 Que: What is Instance Control flow in Java?
 
 Ans-> Instance Control flow will begin when the object is created, when object is created memory will be allocated for instance variable
 instance method and instance block
 
 Once memory allocation will be completed then execution will happen in below order
 a)instance block
 b) Constructor
 c) instance method (if we call)
 
 Note -> Static members can be access directly in instance areas because for static members memory will be already
 allocated at the time of class loading.
 
 ===================================================================================================================================================
 
 java.lang.Object Class =
 
 ->Object is a pre-defined class available in java.lang.package
 -> Object class will act as super class for all classes in java either directly or indirectly
 
 Object class does have 11 methods, those methods are by default available for every java object
 
 Demo d = new Demo();
 d.equal();
 d.toString();
 d.hashCode();
 
 The process of creating a duplicate object is known as cloning.
 
 
 Protected Object Clone() 
 boolean equals(object obj)
 protected void finalize()
 Class <?> getClass()
 int hashCode()
 
 String toString() 
 -> used to return the object in string format
 When we print any object or when we call toString method it will call toString method by default.
 
 Object Class toString Method implementation---
 
 public String toString()
 {	
 	return this.getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(this.hashCode());
 }
 
 
 These five we will learn in multi-threading--
 notify()
 notifyAll()
 wait() 
 void wait (long timeout)
 void wait(long timeout, int nanos)
 
 =================================================================================
 
 equals() of object class does compare address of Object 
 and equals() is overriden in String class and it does compare the content 
 
 hashcode -> this method return the hexa decimal format of address of object
 
 ==============================================================================
 
 Class Object
java.lang.Object

public class Object
Class Object is the root of the class hierarchy. Every class has Object as a superclass. All objects, including arrays, implement the methods of this class.
Since:
JDK1.0

Modifier and Type	Method and Description
protected Object	clone()
Creates and returns a copy of this object.
boolean	equals(Object obj)
Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.
protected void	finalize()
Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object.
Class<?>	getClass()
Returns the runtime class of this Object.
int	hashCode()
Returns a hash code value for the object.
void	notify()
Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.
void	notifyAll()
Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor.
String	toString()
Returns a string representation of the object.
void	wait()
Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify() method or the notifyAll() method for this object.
void	wait(long timeout)
Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the notify() method or the notifyAll() method for this object, or a specified amount of time has elapsed.
void	wait(long timeout, int nanos)
Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify() method or the notifyAll() method for this object, or some other thread interrupts the current thread, or a certain amount of real time has elapsed.

If we want to clone an object then our class needs to implement cloneable interface

Que: How many ways are there to create object?
Ans: using clone() method
using new operator
using newInstance() method - method present in class is used to create object

=====================================|
finalize() method:					 |
=====================================|

-> When garbage collector removes any object from JVm then it will call finalize() method
It is also available in the Object class.

Note: Garbage collector are used to remove unused or un-referenced object from heap area.
