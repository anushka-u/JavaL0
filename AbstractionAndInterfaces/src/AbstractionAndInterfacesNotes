====================
ABSTRACTION
=====================

-> The process of hiding un-necessary data and providing
only useful data is called as abstraction
-> We can achieve abstraction using interfaces & abstract class

In java we can write two types of method -
1 - Concrete Method
2 - Abstract Method

The method which contain the body is called as Concrete method
Ex
public void m1()
{
	//logic
}
or 
public void m1() // this is also concrete as it's not have abstract keyword at front
{
}

The method which does not contain the body is called as Abstract Method
Ex -
public abstract void m2();

Note -- By using abstract keyword we can create abstract method and abstract classes.
================================
Interfaces
===============

Interfaces are used to achieve loosely coupling
It is use to hide un-necessary data and provide useful data.

if one class is directly dependent on another class that is known as tightly coupling
To avoid tightly coupling we use Interface
Interfaces contains abstract method (Statement true till Java 1.7)

Once interfaces is created then anybody can provide implementation of interface\

We use interface keyword to create an interface.

whenever we write a method in interface then by default that method is abstract method
Interface doesn't contain constructor, we cannot create the object for interface.

To implemtnt a interface we will use implement keyword

Implementation of method can be changed from one class to another class but method shouldn't be changed.

Interface will use to decide the rules and the classes implementing
Interface will be follow those all rules


========================================================
A class can extend only one method but implements several methods.
