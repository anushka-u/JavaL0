====================
ABSTRACTION
=====================

-> The process of hiding un-necessary data and providing
only useful data is called as abstraction
-> We can achieve abstraction using interfaces & abstract class

In java we can write two types of method -
1 - Concrete Method
2 - Abstract Method

The method which contain the body is called as Concrete method
Ex
public void m1()
{
	//logic
}
or 
public void m1() // this is also concrete as it's not have abstract keyword at front
{
}

The method which does not contain the body is called as Abstract Method
Ex -
public abstract void m2();

Note -- By using abstract keyword we can create abstract method and abstract classes.
================================
Interfaces
===============

Interfaces are used to achieve loosely coupling
It is use to hide un-necessary data and provide useful data.

if one class is directly dependent on another class that is known as tightly coupling
To avoid tightly coupling we use Interface
Interfaces contains abstract method (Statement true till Java 1.7)

Once interfaces is created then anybody can provide implementation of interface\

We use interface keyword to create an interface.

whenever we write a method in interface then by default that method is abstract method
Interface doesn't contain constructor, we cannot create the object for interface.

To implement a interface we will use implement keyword

Implementation of method can be changed from one class to another class but method shouldn't be changed.

Interface will use to decide the rules and the classes implementing
Interface will be follow those all rules

We cannot write a main method inside interface because interface should only contain abstract method and main is a concrete method.

We can call interface as a method parameter.
Interface reference variable can hold it's implementation class object

When method is taking interface as parameter that means that method is taking interface implementation class
object as a parameter

When method is having interface as a return type then that means that method will return interface implementation
object as a return type
========================================================
A class can extend only one class but can implements several interfaces.

Classes are tightly coupled

-> If interface doesn't contain any method then that interface is called as "Marker Interface"
-> Marker Interface is nothing but  Identity Interface.
-> Example of MArker Interface are Cloneable, Serializable ... etc
 
 -> if our class implements pre-defined interface then JVM will treat our classes as
 special classes and it will provide special functionality based on the marker interfaces we have 
 implemented.

->We can create and use our own marker interface but there is no use of it because
JVM only identifies Pre-defined marker interface and doesn't know about our defined marker interface.


-> Functional Interface
==> The interface which contains only one method is called as functional interfaces
Functional interface are introduced to called "Lambda Expressions"

Lambda Expression is used for functional programming.

===========================================================
If you don't want to implement all method of interface then our class should be defined as abstract class.

=> One interface cannot implement another interface but it can extends another interface

=> In interface we can declare variables also, by default they are public static final.
It is not mandatory to use abstract keyword while defining a method in 
interface because compiler will make the defined method in interface as abstract by default.

=====================================================================================================================================


|===============================|
|	     Abstract class		    |
|===============================|

-> The class which contains both abstract and concrete method is known as Abstract class
-> We will used  'abstract' keyword to represent class as abstract class
-> To write abstract method  'abstract' keyword is mandatory in abstract class.

 Abstract class contains constructor but still object for abstract classes cannot be created
// To create an object of abstract class, a subclass is required which does implement the abstract class.


When we extend properties for abstract class then it is mandatory for the class to override the method
the abstract method of abstract class.

We cannot use abstract and final in one method

public abstract final void m1(); // Invalid
Final means cannot be modifies and implemented in short don't override.
Abstract means overriding

Abstract class constructor will be executed when we create an object for sub class of abstract class
