TYPE CASTING
==================
Converting from one data type to another data type is knows as Type Casting
Type casting is dividied into two typws
1) Widening / UpCasting
2) Narrowing / downCasting

byte b =20;
int i = b; //widening

The process of storing lower data type to higher datatype is known as Widening or UPCasting
We don't need to do explicit casting while doing widening
Ex byte b = 67;
int i =b; //Widening

The process of storing higher data type  into lower data type is known as NArrowing or downcasting
We do need to do explicit casting 
The data could be loss in case of Narrowing
long l = 3456;
int i = (int)l; //Narrowing


===============================================================
-> String type data can be converted into Integer by using Integer.parseInt(xx) method
-> parseInt() is a static method available in Integer Wrapper Class.

String s= "h1";
int i = Integer.parseInt(s) ; // Will be getting Unchecked Exception NumberFormatException
---------------------
.parseDouble
.parseShort
.parseFloat  etcetra methods are there
------------------------------------------

Type Casting w.r.t to Referece Type:

-> Parent object can be converted to child class.
-> Cloneable - Marker Interface
