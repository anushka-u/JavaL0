Static Import
=================
Static import is used to access static members directly without using class name.

To call static method of s class inside a package and we are importing that package
into another package then to call static methods you need to use class name

Normal import
import com.ibm.aadhar.person;

->Person.speak()
person.m1()
person.m2()

To overcome calling the method without class name you can use static import

import static ibm.aadhar.person.Person;

speak()
m1();
m2();

====================================================================================
Variable Arguments::
Unlimited argument for a single method
Syntax
------
<access_specifier> <return_type> <Method_Name>(<datatype>... varName)

public int add(int... a)

->Ellipses (only 3 ellipses are allowed)
-> when we don't know how many parameters to take for a method then variable argument should be allowed
-> Variable Argument concept is introduced in Java 1.5 version
-> Variable argument will be the last argument in a method.
-> A method should contain only one variable argument


=============================================================================
Wrapper Classes:

-> for every data type there is a wrapper classes available in Java
-> To represent everything in form of Object Java has provided Wrapper classes
->In java we can represent everything in for of object
-> Wrapper class represent primitive type in Object format
-> All wrapper classes are part of java.lang package

 DataType - WrapperClass
-> byte	 -  Byte
->short --> Short
->int 	--> Integer
->long 	---> Long
->float ---> Float
->double ---> Double
->char -->  Character
->boolean ----> Boolean


Boxing: The process of Converting Primitive type into Wrappper Object is known as Boxing
UnBoxing : The Process of converting wrapper object into primitive type ic called as UnBoxing


We are only telling and JVM is working boxing and unboxing
From java 1.5 boxing and unboxing process automated so it is called as auto boxing and auto unboxing.


Every wrapper class has two constructor except character, one take
